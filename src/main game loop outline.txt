## Main game loop initiated by PaxGhostsGame:
    1. PaxGhostsGame.populate() method:
        a. Get both counts
        b. Get goth gestation period counts
        c. Get stavation count for Ghost instance
    2. All passed to WorldGrid.populate() :
        a. two loops: Pax and Ghost
        b. Pax loop:
            i. iterate 0 through count-1
                1. pick Random point from (0,0) to (99, 99) inclusive
                    a. if point is empty, place organism there
                    b. if not empty, pick new Random point and go back to 2.
                2. take gestationPax integer value and set it for the file's use
        c. Ghost loop:
            i. iterate 0 through count-1
                1. pick Random point from (0,0) to (99, 99) inclusive
                    a. if point is empty, place organism there
                    b. if not empty, pick new Random point and go back to 2.
                2. take gestationGhost integer value and set it for the file's use
                3. take starvationGhost integer value and set it for the file's use
    3. When populate is finished, simulate one step
        a. Simulation proceeds in loop through grid:
            i. Grid iterated through from (0,0) to (99,99) :
                1. each column after another; then each row in each column, from bottom to top
                2. organism simulated:
                    a. if Pax:
                        i. if both Pax and Ghost have same current location:
                            1. change Pax currentState to die
                            2. unpaint Pax pixel
                            3. have Ghost pixel painted at location
                        ii. .simulate() is called
                        iii. if both currentMovement is not STATIC and currentState is MOVE:
                            1. then animate direction movement; that is, pixel repainting
                                a. at new location (.getLocation)
                        iv. else if currentMovement is STATIC and currentState is LIVE:
                            1. simply keep pixel painted at location
                        v. if willReproduce is true, then:
                            1. set, in another grid of Cell instances:
                                a. that location's cell's willBePopulated to true
                    b. if Ghost:
                        i. if both Ghost and Pax have same current location:
                            1. just make sure that Ghost pixel is painted there
                        ii. .simulate() is called
                        iii. if willDie is true, then de-animate pixel and:
                            1. set cell at that location to EMPTY
                        iv. if both currentMovement is not STATIC and currentState is MOVE:
                            1. then animate direction movement; that is, pixel repainting
                                a. at new location (.getLocation)
                        v. else if currentMovement is STATIC and currentState is LIVE:
                            1. simply keep pixel painted at location
                        vi. if willReproduce is true, then:
                            1. set, in another grid of Cell instances:
                                a. that location's cell's willBePopulated to true
    4. Check to see if any of the instances in that other grid have willBePopulated as true
        i. If so, populate original grid appropriately
            a. if there are any space conflicts, just don't populate and animate those
    5. Check to see if populate values changed
        i. If so, reset WorldGrid and repopulate (outline step 2.)
        ii. If not, continue simulating (that is, do another step of 3.)
